description: >
  This example counts the number of single-precision floating-point
  numbers between two bounding single-precision floating-point
  numbers.  The bounding numbers are required to be sufficiently
  close that we know an upper bound on the count.  The benchmark
  checks that the count does not exceed this bound.
