# Floating point benchmarks

This is a collection of synthetic and "real world" benchmarks
written in C that use floating point numbers.

The benchmarks use the `spec.yml` format used by [fp-bench](https://github.com/delcypher/fp-bench).

Several category name conventions are used

* `ase_2017` - Benchmarks intended for study
* `imperial` - Benchmarks from Imperial College London
* `synthetic` - Benchmarks that are synthetic
* `real_world` - Benchmarks that at least partially represent real world code.

# Build system

Drop this directory into the `benchmarks` folder in
[fp-bench](https://github.com/delcypher/fp-bench)
with the name `imperial`.
