description: >
  Adapted from the spmatrix.c example that comes with GSL.
  The unmodified program builds a 5-by-4 sparse matrix and prints it
  in various forms.  The KLEE version makes the layout and contents
  of the matrix partially symbolic.  If BUG is defined, there is an 
  assertion that the matrix cannot have the sparse layout prescribed
  by the example (which in fact it can, if the symbolic matrix layout
  is concretised to match the example.)
