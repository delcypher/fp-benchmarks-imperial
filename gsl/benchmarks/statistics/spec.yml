description: >
  Adapted from the stat.c example that comes with GSL.
  The unmodified program does some simple statistics on some concrete
  values.  The KLEE version makes some of these values symbolic with
  appropriate ranges, and checks that the statistical results are within
  the bounds allowed by these ranges.   If BUG is defined, a NaN value
  is introduced to wreck all the stats.
