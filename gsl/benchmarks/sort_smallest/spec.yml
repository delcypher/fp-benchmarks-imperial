description: >
  Adapted from the sortsmall.c example that comes with GSL.
  The example uses the function gsl_sort_smallest to select the SMALL_LENGTH
  smallest numbers from LENGTH uniform random variates stored in an
  array; these are symbolic in the case of KLEE.  An assertion checks
  that the first two output numbers are indeed sorted.  An injected
  bug can be enabled to swap them, to make this assertion fail.
