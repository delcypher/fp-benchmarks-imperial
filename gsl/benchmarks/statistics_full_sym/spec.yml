description: >
  Adapted from the stat.c example that comes with GSL.  The unmodified program
  does some simple statistics on some concrete values. This is a variant of the
  `statistics` benchmark. It is not declared as a variant of `statistics` to
  avoid interfering with the existing benchmarks.
